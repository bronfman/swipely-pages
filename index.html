        <p>Swipely Pages is a template for a Responsive Design-based web
experience that scales easily up from a limited phone to desktop, centered
around swiping pages and panels from a central menu. Swipely Pages
is not a finished web template, but an example of how this could
be done; it will need to be heavily customized for every deployment.
This experiment is based on <a href="http://www.torkiljohnsen.com/">Torkil Johnsen</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/torkiljohnsen/swipe">Swipe</a>.</p>

<p>Swipely Pages is best used for web sites that have a limited number
of pages that are all related to through a central menu. It arranges
these pages based on the size of the view-port of the browser and
the JavaScript capabilities.</p>

<p>The starting page of a Swipely Pages site is index.html . It contains
the opening paragraph and menu to go to the other pages.</p>

<p><strong>Limited phones</strong> The index.html is loaded, and the user can jump from
the menu to any page, as usual.</p>

<p><strong>Small smarter phones that run JavaScript</strong> the index.html page will
load the first sub-page and show it in a panel. Touch devices will
let the user swipe the panel in and out of view, other devices can
use the menu to swipe the panel into view.</p>

<p><strong>Tablets, larger viewports</strong> index.html will use JavaScript to load
all panels in a continuous ribbon. The user can either swipe to the
desired page or jump from the menu. Desktops do not have touch and
scrolling horizontally is not enabled, so the user goes to the next
panel using the Next button.</p>

<h2>ISSUES</h2>

<ul>
<li>Doesn't perform scrolling well on earlier Android devices.</li>
<li>Horizontal scrolling to swipe should work on desktop, has currently not been coded in.</li>
</ul>

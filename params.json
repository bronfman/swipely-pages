{"name":"Swipely-pages","body":"Swipely Pages is a template for a Responsive Design-based web\r\nexperience that scales easily up from a limited phone to desktop, centered\r\naround swiping pages and panels from a central menu. Swipely Pages\r\nis not a finished web template, but an example of how this could\r\nbe done; it will need to be heavily customized for every deployment.\r\nThis experiment is based on [Torkil Johnsen](http://www.torkiljohnsen.com/)'s [Swipe](https://github.com/torkiljohnsen/swipe).\r\n\r\nSwipely Pages is best used for web sites that have a limited number\r\nof pages that are all related to through a central menu. It arranges\r\nthese pages based on the size of the view-port of the browser and\r\nthe JavaScript capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe starting page of a Swipely Pages site is index.html . It contains\r\nthe opening paragraph and menu to go to the other pages.\r\n\r\n**Limited phones** The index.html is loaded, and the user can jump from\r\nthe menu to any page, as usual.\r\n\r\n**Small smarter phones that run JavaScript** the index.html page will\r\nload the first sub-page and show it in a panel. Touch devices will\r\nlet the user swipe the panel in and out of view, other devices can\r\nuse the menu to swipe the panel into view.\r\n\r\n**Tablets, larger viewports** index.html will use JavaScript to load\r\nall panels in a continuous ribbon. The user can either swipe to the\r\ndesired page or jump from the menu. Desktops do not have touch and\r\nscrolling horizontally is not enabled, so the user goes to the next\r\npanel using the Next button.\r\n\r\n## ISSUES\r\n* Doesn't perform scrolling well on earlier Android devices.\r\n* Horizontal scrolling to swipe should work on desktop, has currently not been coded in.","tagline":"A swipe-based responsive design experiment and template","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
